# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 22nd, Thursday.
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Just some Python scripts after reading about os module and terminal arguments from sys module.  

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to reading some ML and practicing and reading about it on dataquest.io. Also looking forward to learning Web-Development using ruby, from theodinproject.com.
Well from now on (as I did not read the rules properly) I will, contribute by doing some Real Projects, worth looking forward to. Just need some ideas. #Lets put it forward to 101.

**Link to work:** I would like to enter a link here and there. :P
